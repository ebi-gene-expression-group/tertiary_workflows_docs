Writing documentation
#####################

Documentation should be written in reStructuredText for full compatibility with 'Read the Docs' and we encourage you to add and update documentation as you contribute code elements. Please follow the style guide at https://documentation-style-guide-sphinx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style-guide.html, for example in the syntax used for different heading levels.

You'll need to obtain access to the `documentation repository <https://github.com/ebi-gene-expression-group/tertiary_workflows_docs>`_ and make changes to documentation via pull requests to that respository.
